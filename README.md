# pbap-android

Android app for transfering contacts from one phone to another via Bluetooth.

**Disclaimer: this app may not work in its current state, or may have critical bugs.**

Sometime in the future I will rebuild this application, but in the meantime you are probably better off using an app released on the Play store.
